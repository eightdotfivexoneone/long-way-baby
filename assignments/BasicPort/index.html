            <!-- TEXT -->
            Steve Bowden is a designer, researcher, practitioner and educator with nearly two decades of experience in his field. Spanning a wide array of disciplines – from printing and publishing, to typography and woodworking, branding, packaging, and interaction design – his work is unified by a common thread of reading objects, words and images.
            <br>
            Steve’s current research involves the investigation of letterforms, words and images as they relate to technology, production and communication. Most recently he has been exploring methods of mixing and misusing analog and digital processes from different periods of history to disrupt traditional notions of legibility and craft. This research introduces a fresh perspective in approach and form that enable his students to freely explore their own possibilities without inhibiting fears of risk or failure.

He holds an undergraduate degree in graphic design from Maine College of Art, Portland, Maine, USA and a masters degree in 2D design from Cranbrook Academy of Art, Detroit Michigan, USA.
